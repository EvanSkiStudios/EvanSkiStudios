## About Me

Hello! I'm an independent programmer passionate about creating games, applications, and various other projects. I primarily use GameMaker Language (GML), but I also dabble in other professional programming languages.

### My Work

I develop games under the name **EvanskiStudios**.  
Occasionally, I collaborate with friends in an indie group called **Pixellated Hammered Raccoon**.  
Together, we create games for the GameMaker Community Jam, which I previously co-hosted.  

## Projects and Contributions

### Notable Projects

- **[FlukeBot](https://github.com/EvanSkiStudios/flukebot)**: A Discord AI LLM chat bot  
- **[F.U.R](https://github.com/EvanSkiStudios/FUR)**: A repo of free-to-use scripts and assets for GameMaker.
- **[AutoPaste](https://github.com/EvanSkiStudios/AutoPaste)**: A Python script that converts what's in your clipboard to keypresses, useful for when normal copypaste won't work.
